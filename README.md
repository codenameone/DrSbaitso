# DrSbaitso

Dr. Sbatiso is a homage to an old soundblaster demo where a computerized therapist tries to help you with your problems. The demo was first presented in a JavaZone workshop on Codename One and aims to teach several core tenants of the framework.

- It uses image capture for the users avatar
- Uses masking to produce a round effect on the image
- Native interfaces for text to speech support (TTS) which are implemented on Android, iOS and in JavaScript (chrome only at this time)

The demo also shows off a chat like interface in the style of instant messaging apps. It also provides a powerful instant search mechanism. 

You can try the demo live in the web using the JavaScript port [here](https://www.codenameone.com/demos/DrSbaitso) or check out other ports in the [demo page](https://www.codenameone.com/demos-DrSbaitso.html).
